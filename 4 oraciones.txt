If I had Lionel Messi in front of me, I would ask for his autograph and take a photo with him. It would be amazing!
If I were the president of Peru, I would focus on improving education, healthcare, and the economy to benefit the people.
If I were an astronaut, I would explore outer space, conduct experiments, and contribute to our understanding of the universe. It would be a dream come true!If I didn't find the teacher in class on the day of the exam, I would try to reach out to them through email or phone to get instructions or guidance on what to do next.
